A modern software-development practice that decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick changes to feature availability on demand. It uses a technique called feature flags(als know as feature toggles, feature switches, and so on) to dynamically administer a feature's lifecycle.
## Feature flag
A feature flag is a variable with a binary state of _on_ or _off_. The feature flag has also an associated code block. The state of the feature flag triggers whetther the code block runs or not.
## Feature manager
A feature manager is an application package that handles the lifecycle of all the feature flags in an application. The feature manager typically provides additional functionality, such as caching feature flags and updating their states.
## Filter (App Features)
